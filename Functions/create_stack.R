## Create raster objects using cellFromXY and generate a raster stack
## create.stack takes pre, tmp, tmn and tmx and creates a raster object stack of 12 month data

  ##### column names and later layer names for raster stack objects ####
  months <- c("jan", "feb", "mar", "apr", "may", "jun", "jul", "aug", "sep", "oct", "nov", "dec")
  
  ## set up a raster object to use as the basis for converting CRU data to raster objects at 10 arc minute resolution ####
  x <- raster(nrows = 900, ncols = 2160, ymn = -60, ymx = 90, xmn = -180, xmx = 180) 
  
  ## determine the cells with values in CRU data
  cells <- cellFromXY(x, wvar[, c(2, 1)])
