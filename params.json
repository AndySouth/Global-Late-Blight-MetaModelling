{"name":"Global late blight modelling","tagline":"R Scripts and supporting data for creating metamodels,  as published in Ecosphere, and using them to generate global estimates of potato late blight risk based on climate data as published in Global Change Biology.","body":"Global-Late-Blight-Modelling\r\n============================\r\n\r\nThis repository hosts R Scripts and the data necessary for creating metamodels of blight units based on the SimCast model modified by [Grünwald et al. (2002)](http://grunwaldlab.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/potato-late-blight-management-toluca-valley-field-validation-simcast-modified-cultivars-high-field). Other scripts include tools to predict growing seasons using Ecocrop and estimating global late blight severity using monthly time-step weather data to generate maps of potato late blight risk.\r\n\r\nThe metamodelling approach can be found in, [Sparks, A. H., Forbes, G. A., Hijmans, R. J., & Garrett, K. A. (2011). A metamodeling framework for extending the application domain of process-based ecological models. Ecosphere, 2(8), art90. doi:10.1890/ES11-00128.1](http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/es11-00128.1).\r\n\r\nThe study for which these models were developed can be found in [Sparks, A. H., Forbes, G. A, Hijmans, R. J., & Garrett K. A. (2014). Climate change may have little effect on global risk of potato late blight.

This is useful for a GIS or other application where you don't need to use R. Values start at 70% RH and go to 100% RH in 1º C increments up to 35º C, anything below 70% RH or above 35º  C in metamodel can be assumed to be zero blight units.\r\n      * resistant_daily_gam.txt - Look up table values for a resistant potato cultivar, daily time-step\r\n      * resistant_monthly_gam.txt - Look up table values for a resistant potato cultivar, daily time-step\r\n      * susceptible_daily_gam.txt - Look up table values for a resistant potato cultivar, daily time-step\r\n      * susceptible_monthly_gam.txt - Look up table values for a resistant potato cultivar, daily time-step\r\n  * **Planting Seasons**\r\n      * CRU_CL20_Potato_Plant.grd/.gri - R raster package native file of combined rainfed and irrigated potato planting dates based on CRU CL2.0 data using EcoCrop to predict the month for crop establishment that results in the highest yield, generated using the script, EcoCrop CRU CL2.0 Potato Growing Seasons.R, found in the Models directory\r\n      * CRU_CL20_PIR.grd/.gri - R raster package native file of irrigated potato planting dates based on CRU CL2.0 data using EcoCrop to predict the month for crop establishment that results in the highest yield, generated using the script, EcoCrop CRU CL2.0 Potato Growing Seasons.R, found in the Models directory\r\n      * CRU_CL20_PRF.grd/.gri - R raster package native file of rainfed potato planting dates based on CRU CL2.0 data using EcoCrop to predict the month for crop establishment that results in the highest yield, generated using the script, EcoCrop CRU CL2.0 Potato Growing Seasons.R, found in the Models directory\r\n* **Data** - Contains supporting data that is unmodified, nothing should be upload here via git. It is for downloading and storage only while in use.\r\n* **Functions** - Contains scripts with functions that are used across several scripts for sharing\r\n      * ecospat.R - Function used to run the EcoCrop model to predict planting dates for use with SimCastMeta\r\n* **Models** - Contains the scripts for the models used in this project\r\n  * EcoCrop CRU CL2.0 Potato Growing Seasons.R - Downloads CRU CL2.0 data from CRU [New et al. 2000](http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/tmc/new_et_al_10minute_climate_CR.pdf)\r\n  and MIRCA2000 from Uni Frankfurt, MIRCA2000, [(Portman et al. 2000)](http://www2.uni-frankfurt.de/45218023/MIRCA?legacy_request=1), to generate maps of potato planting dates, output files are found in \"Cache/Planting Seasons\"\r\n  * SimCast_Blight_Units.R - The blight unit portion of the SimCast model, as described in [Grünwald et al. 2002](http://grunwaldlab.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/potato-late-blight-management-toluca-valley-field-validation-simcast-modified-cultivars-high-field)\r\n  * SimCastMeta.R - The metamodel, as described in [Sparks et al. 2011](http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/es11-00128.1)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
